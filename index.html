                    ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
                    Kalam planned the program that produced
                    a number of successful missiles, which
                    helped earn him the nickname
                    <strong>

                    the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests

                    established Kalam as a national hero,
                    although the tests caused great concern
                    in the international community.

                    a less-developed to a developed society
                    in 20 years. The plan called for, among

                    productivity, emphasizing technology as
                    a vehicle for economic growth, and
                    widening access to health care and
